Python 3 to Javascript translator written in Python that produce fast portable javascript code.

Getting started (2 minutes)
===========================

You will need Python 3 to run the translator. Refer to your operating system documentation to know how to do it. 

Then you can use pip to install the stable translator::

  pip install pythonium-core

The above package installs ``pythonium_core`` command that has the following options::

  pythonium_core [--generate-requirejs-modules] FILE [FILE ...]

  Will generate FILE.js based on FILE.

  --generate-requirejs-modules: generate requirejs modules
  --help: show help



What? (2 minutes)
=================

Pythonium will exists in several flavors, each of which with their own strength and performance. The more you dive into the list to more feature you have, the less performance you can except:

- Pythonium **Core**

  - Fully portable
  - Native Javascript speed
  - Exact same syntax as Python 3
  - Compatible with existing Javascript libraries
  - Function with positional arguments are translated to javascript functions
  - Automatic scope handling and ``global`` support
  - ``for`` iterates over javascript arrays
  - Python types are mapped to javascript types
  - Anonymous exceptions with ``__exception__`` special variable
  - Support of ``yield``
  - ``print`` is translated to ``console.log``
  - ``new(SomeObject, arg0, arg1)`` is a special function that translates to Javascript ``new SomeObject(arg0, args1)`` with any number of arguments
  - if ``__DOLLAR__`` is found in any name, it will be remplaced by ``$`` character.
  - Support of ``import ... from ...`` via `requirejs <http://requirejs.org/>`_
  - Support of single inheritance classes via `classy <http://classy.pocoo.org/>`_ [1][2]

- Pythonium **Veloce** support all the above features and adds the following: 

  - One dependency ``pythonium.veloce.js`` expected to be 10kb
  - Full Python function signature support with ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``
  - Support of ``__getattribute__`` and ``__getattr__`` hooks
  - Support of metaclass
  - Support for ``list``, ``dict``, ``set``, ``float``, ``int``, ``str``
  - Full support of ``for`` 
  - Full support of exceptions
  - Support of ``with``
  - Support of ``yield from``

- Pythonium **Compliant** 100% compliant with CPython 3

Why? (5 minutes)
================

Is 100% is of any interest right **now**? Do you need to build anything that use **all the features** of CPython right now? **No**. 

Can you trade some features for speed? **Yes**.

For the industry, experienced programers, and hobbyst, what is best is to have something tailored to get things done in the browser with the syntax they prefer. 

Anyway, the APIs are different from backend and desktop, so there will be things to learn. For instance, if you choose **pythonium core** you will need to learn to work with Javascript arrays and objects and work around their specificities. Working around specifities of the *language* can be boring, but it's the best that is available right now, and it's after all, not that bad.

As a programmer that knows both Python and Javascript, I prefer to focus on what is the easiest for me to do and maximise what I will be able to do next. The immediate answer to this answer is what is already available in the repository.

I understand, that in the long run it's nice to have fully compliant Python in the browser, for learning purpose, to avoid bugs that are not reported correctly and many things. That said, I prefer to focus on tooling, library support, demos and other things that can allow people like me to get things done.

I've already done it in `PythonJS <https://github.com/PythonJS/PythonJS>`_, I know it's possible to even have 100% compliance. PythonJS code is poor, I though it was possible to improve the things so I started this new project.

[0] Except for class support and ``from ... import ...``
[1] Nested class definition are not supported
[2] Calling super method is done with ``super(arg0, arg1, arg2, ...)``
